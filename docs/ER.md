# ER: Requirements Specification Component

TasteBuds helps people build a community of diverse, healthy and tasty eating habits.

## A1: TasteBuds

The purpose of this project is to develop a web application for a social network that enables people to share cooking recipes with the world. The main stakeholders of this platform are the producer and the consumer, and a user may be both. The producers look for a way to share their recipes with the world, hopefully gaining some visibility from it and possibly attracting people to their business or any other ventures they have. The consumers look for a way to find new recipes that they haven’t tried before.

Technology is always evolving to improve and facilitate people’s lives. Cooking is one of the things we do every day, and it would be useful to have a tool to ease the task of remembering all the cooking recipes while helping people diversify and improve their diet. This application enables the formation of a community where people help each other create even better recipes.

The website has a responsive and intuitive design, where all users can share recipes that can be private, visible to followers or public. These recipes can include text, links, photos or videos. The user can create an account in the website and then authenticate himself with a username and password. Recipes are tagged and can be searched, filtered, sorted and saved to the user's favourites list. This also allows users to give a list of the ingredients they have at home and filter for recipes that need them. A recommendation algorithm is used to order recipes by default in the user feed. Users can view, comment and rate posts when the necessary permissions are met.

Users can follow accounts and set their profile as private so people need their confirmation to follow. They can also create public and private groups where users can easily share recipes with specific friends. The users can also send direct private messages to each other.

TasteBuds has different types of users. The visitor is able to navigate through the website, look up other people’s profiles and public recipes but not comment or create posts and send messages. The member has the ability to comment and create posts, send messages, perform reviews on recipes, access his profile menu and change his personal information. The group moderators have the ability to manage their groups, such as approving membership requests, removing members and editing the group information. Lastly, the administrators are responsible for the management of the entire website. They don’t have the ability to create, comment or make a review about a post but they do have the possibility of removing offensive content and banning users.

## A2: Actors and User stories

This artefact contains the specification of the actors and possible relations between them, user stories, and some project requirements, serving as agile documentation.

## A3: User Interface Prototype

This artefact contains the prototype of all user interfaces. Its goal is to validate the correctness of previously defined user requirements, preview, test, and enable multiple iterations on the design of the user interface.

### 1. Interface and common features

TasteBuds is a web application based on HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS. The user interface was implemented using the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) framework.

Desktop           |  Mobile
-------------------------|-------------------------
![](https://i.imgur.com/1q7zGyY.png)  |  ![](https://i.imgur.com/7NMxqXh.png)

**Figure 2:** Interface's guidelines


1. Navbar
2. Logo
3. Search box
4. Sign In/Sign Up Area
5. Page Content
6. Footer

In this figure some characteristics common to all pages are highlighted:

* The user interface was developed taking all kinds of users into account. The result is an intuitive experience, no matter your background.
* The implemented web design is responsive allowing various screen sizes and resolutions, from a 15" or more desktop to a 4" smartphone.
* Through the website, all common links and buttons to the several pages, especially the ones placed in the navigation bar and footer, maintain their position to deliver a consistent user experience. Furthermore, the page margins also follow a common standard.
* All different sections are distinctly styled to denote different hierarchies of the presented information. 

**Note:** Regarding the mobile view, when clicking "Search" or "Menu", a dropdown is presented with the referenced information.

### 2. Sitemap

A sitemap visually represents the relationships between different pages of the website by showing how all the information fits together. Moreover, it gives a general idea of how the website is internally structured into different areas.

### 3. Wireflow

A Wireflow represents some of the main system interactions using a sequence of interfaces and describing how navigation is done between them.
